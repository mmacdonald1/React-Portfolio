      <h5> I am close to reaching my two-year code-anniversary! April 2017 I quit my sales job and used all my earnings to buy my first online course in Front-end Development and Web Design. I spent the next 4 months speeding through HTML and CSS eventually hitting my first JavaScript wall. So I signed up for my first boot camp that was completely JavaScript front to back.
      </h5>
      <h5> After graduating in January 2018, I took on a small freelance job, a code based teaching position for high schoolers, and I continued to self-teach.Â When I joined Flatiron school, I was given three weeks to take on Ruby, Sinatra, and Rails. They started me with building CRUD apps in Sinatra and Rails and then I moved into learning more about Ruby. Along the way I also dove deeper into the inner workings of JavaScript and took on new tools in React. I have found that my hunger for building apps with these new tools is growing so I am now looking for new opportunities!
